#### About App
- This app is having feature of "Drawer Layout and Bottom Navigation Tab"
- This app is developed using the concept of activity and fragment along with feature of dataBinding.


#### Features that can be added if I get some more time
- App can be developed using mvvm architecture.
- For now , only base fragment is created to avoid boiler plate code but we can also add viewbinding to base fragment and code can be more optimized.
- Network connectivity can be handled to display some default message if internet connection is not there.
- Name on the top bar can be same as the bottom navigation selected.
- Test cases can be added.
